# CountyDataSync CI/CD Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate CountyDataSync into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, including automated testing, packaging, error monitoring, and scheduled maintenance tasks.

## 1. Automated Error Monitoring with Sentry

### Sentry Integration

1. Install the Sentry SDK
2. Initialize Sentry in your code (sync.py or app.py)
3. Configure environment variables in GitHub repository secrets

## 2. Scheduled Database Backups

Create a backup script (backup_script.py) to copy your database files to a backup directory with timestamps.

## 3. Health Checks and Data Integrity Testing

Create a health check script (health_check.py) to verify database integrity by checking if tables exist and have records.

## 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

Create a workflow file (.github/workflows/main.yml) with jobs for:
- Building, testing, and packaging the application
- Running scheduled backups
- Optional deployment to production

## 5. Setting Up GitHub Repository Secrets

Configure secrets in your GitHub repository for:
- Sentry DSN
- Database credentials
- Server access (if deploying)

## 6. Continuous Integration Best Practices

- Test regularly on every push
- Keep secrets secure
- Monitor build times
- Set up artifact retention policies
- Configure notifications for failures

By implementing this CI/CD pipeline, you'll automate testing, packaging, and maintenance tasks for CountyDataSync, ensuring reliable and consistent deployments.
