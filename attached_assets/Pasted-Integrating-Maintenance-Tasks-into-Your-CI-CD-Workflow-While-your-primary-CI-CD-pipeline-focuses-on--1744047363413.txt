Integrating Maintenance Tasks into Your CI/CD Workflow
While your primary CI/CD pipeline focuses on testing, packaging, and deployment, you can extend it to run scheduled jobs and maintenance tasks. Here’s how you can integrate several key tasks:

1. Automated Error Monitoring with Sentry
a. Sentry Integration:

For Python:
Install the Sentry SDK:

bash
Copy
pip install sentry-sdk
In your sync.py, initialize Sentry early in your code:

python
Copy
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://your-sentry-dsn",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0
)
For Node.js (if needed):
Install Sentry for Node:

bash
Copy
npm install @sentry/node
And initialize in your backend:

js
Copy
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://your-sentry-dsn" });
Sentry will automatically capture exceptions, which are then available in your Sentry dashboard.

b. CI/CD Integration:

Your CI/CD pipeline doesn’t need to "run" Sentry. Instead, your tests and production code will report errors to Sentry.

Ensure your DSN and related secrets are stored securely (e.g., as GitHub Secrets) and injected into your environment during CI/CD builds.

2. Scheduled Backups via CI/CD
You can use GitHub Actions’ scheduling feature (cron jobs) to trigger backup scripts regularly.

Example Backup Workflow:

Create a new workflow file .github/workflows/backup.yml:

yaml
Copy
name: Database Backup

# Schedule the backup to run daily at 2 AM UTC
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'

jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install pandas sqlite3

      - name: Run Backup Script
        run: |
          python backup_script.py
      - name: Upload Backup Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: backup-files
          path: backup/
In backup_script.py, you could write code to copy your SQLite or GeoPackage files to a backup directory:

python
Copy
import shutil
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Define the backup directory and source files
backup_dir = 'backup'
os.makedirs(backup_dir, exist_ok=True)

files_to_backup = ['stats_db.sqlite', 'working_db.sqlite', 'geo_db.gpkg']
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')

for file in files_to_backup:
    dest = os.path.join(backup_dir, f"{file}.{timestamp}.bak")
    shutil.copy(file, dest)
    print(f"Backed up {file} to {dest}")
This script copies your database files into a backup folder with a timestamp. The workflow then uploads these files as artifacts.

3. Health Checks and Data Integrity Testing
You can create health check scripts to verify that your databases are correctly populated and that the ETL process is performing as expected. Then run these as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Example Health Check Script (health_check.py):

python
Copy
import sqlite3

def check_table(db_file, table):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {table}")
    count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    conn.close()
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    stats_count = check_table('stats_db.sqlite', 'stats')
    working_count = check_table('working_db.sqlite', 'working')
    print(f"Stats table record count: {stats_count}")
    print(f"Working table record count: {working_count}")
    
    if stats_count == 0 or working_count == 0:
        raise Exception("Health check failed: One or more tables are empty.")
    else:
        print("Health check passed.")
Integrate into CI/CD:

Add a step in your main CI/CD workflow after packaging to run the health check:

yaml
Copy
      - name: Run Health Check
        run: python health_check.py
4. CI/CD Pipeline Example Combining All Steps
Here’s an extended GitHub Actions workflow that integrates testing, packaging, backups, and health checks:

yaml
Copy
name: CI/CD - CountyDataSync Maintenance

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # daily backup at 2 AM UTC

jobs:
  build-test-package:
    name: Build, Test, Package CountyDataSync
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest
          pip install pyinstaller
          pip install python-dotenv

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q

      - name: Package with PyInstaller
        run: pyinstaller --onefile sync.py

      - name: Run Health Check
        run: python health_check.py

      - name: Upload Executable Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: county-data-sync-executable
          path: dist/sync*

  backup:
    name: Backup Databases
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'schedule'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install pandas

      - name: Run Backup Script
        run: python backup_script.py

      - name: Upload Backup Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: backup-files
          path: backup/
