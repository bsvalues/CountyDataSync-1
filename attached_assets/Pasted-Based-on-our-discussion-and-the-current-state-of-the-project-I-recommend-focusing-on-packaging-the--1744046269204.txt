Based on our discussion and the current state of the project, I recommend focusing on packaging the sync service next. Packaging it as a standalone executable using PyInstaller is a critical step because it will allow you to deploy the ETL service on machines without needing a full Python environment. Once that's successfully packaged and tested, we can revisit and upgrade the data export mechanism (switching from CSV to SQLite) for enhanced query capabilities and performance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for packaging the sync service with PyInstaller:

---

## **Packaging the Sync Service with PyInstaller**

### **1. Preparation**

- **Ensure Your Code Runs Locally:**  
  Before packaging, run your sync service (e.g., `sync.py`) in your VS Code environment to verify that it works correctly and that all environment variables are properly loaded via your `.env` file.

- **Check Dependencies:**  
  Make sure your `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages (e.g., pandas, geopandas, pyodbc, python-dotenv, etc.).

### **2. Install PyInstaller**

In your terminal (inside VS Code), run:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### **3. Package the Sync Service**

Run the following command in the directory where your `sync.py` is located:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile sync.py
```

- The `--onefile` flag tells PyInstaller to bundle everything into a single executable.
- After running this command, PyInstaller creates a `dist` folder containing the standalone executable (for example, `sync.exe` on Windows).

### **4. Test the Packaged Executable**

1. **Navigate to the `dist` Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd dist
   ```
2. **Run the Executable:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     sync.exe
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     ./sync
     ```
3. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Confirm that the executable correctly loads environment variables.
   - Ensure the ETL process runs as expected (data is extracted, transformed, and loaded).
   - Check that the log file (e.g., `sync.log`) is created and that email alerts are triggered for errors.

### **5. Update Documentation**

- **README Updates:**  
  Add a section detailing the packaging process, including the PyInstaller command and instructions for running the executable.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  Document common issues (e.g., missing environment variables) and how to resolve them.

## **Next Steps After Packaging**

1. **CI/CD Integration:**  
   - Once the packaging works, integrate the PyInstaller packaging process into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and packaging.
2. **Pilot Deployment:**  
   - Deploy the packaged executable to a staging environment and gather feedback.
3. **Upgrade Data Export Mechanism:**  
   - After packaging is stable, we can then move on to upgrading the data export mechanism (switching from CSV to SQLite for the Stats DB and Working DB) for better performance and querying capabilities.

Would you like to proceed with packaging the sync service using PyInstaller next, or do you have any questions about these steps before we move on?
